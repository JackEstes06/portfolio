    <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Jack Estes</strong>. I grew up in Gettysburg,
          Pennsylvania and I love to code, play sports, play video games, and
          play piano. I am 21 years old and attend BYU for college. I am majoring
          in Computer Science and minoring in who knows what at this point
          .</p>

    <p>A fun fact about me is that I love to snowboard! Every year I wait
          for the ski slopes to open so I can bomb the mountains. The fastest
          I have clocked my speed at was 63 mph! However, I also ruined my back
          from falling while going to fast and had to do physical therapy. So
          moral of the story is to have fun but be safe while doing so ;)</p>
